## Interceptor Board config with RPI CM4 (kernel 5.15 + swconfig) 

For this board, you must build the custom kernel and copy the generated .debs to
the dist/ directory before building the `rootfs`.

Also required: the [swconfig package](https://www.axzez.com/software-downloads)
(included as binary in the `files/` dir).
